# Central limit theorem of 28 probability distributions using the probability distribution simulator

> Some cases has been published on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tbThx6Lo5s&list=PLGIquq4uoXLW1n8dU9P_NhmXrVvlU5iE2). Video is better to show the results because there are too many results for each case and this needs to exhibit the Central Limit Theorem property.
