# Abstract

This paper provides a basic investigation of an R-square and sum-square error (SSE) in a linear regression model with the errors following a first-order autoregressive process in which the autocorrelation coefficients are non-zero. The consideration and measurement of the model are difficult to control, thus a computer stimulation is necessary to corroborate how the R-square and SSE are affected by the autocorrelation coefficients. The evidence reveals that the R-square and SSE differ in the ranges of positive and negative autocorrelation coefficients. The results show that it would require one to verify the estimators including the R-square or SSE for testing non-zero autocorrelation coefficients.
