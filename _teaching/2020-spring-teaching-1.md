This course provides students with an understanding of the concept, analysis methods and precise modeling techniques of big tree data analysis. Through the course content, students can understand and use the analytical methods of big data analysis and the first and foremost accurate modeling ability required by big data and artificial intelligence.

Futures
======

1. Learning how simulate data from probabiltiy distributions, to prepare for finding the probaibltiy model for data.

2. Finding the probaiblity model for data by goodness of fit and the curve fitting method. (**Univeral and Unique course to teach you find the probaiblty model for data**, not seeing the frequency plot. )

3. Doing the statistical analysis of confidence interval by finding the data's probabilty distribution first. This way can get the correct critical values for the statistical analayhsis of the parameters or the coefficients of descriptive statistics.

4. Building the accurate model of data. (**Univeral and Unique course to teach the methodology with the outcomes including mathematical equations**.)
