This course provides students with analytical methods to learn artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is to make machines simulate human thinking and decision-making process. Therefore, the analysis method of artificial intelligence is to calculate the data by the machine, and then produce the results according to the principle of decision-making, which can be interpreted and decided by business and management. Through this course, you will learn what artificial intelligence analysis method is, how to calculate and how to interpret reports. Finally, you will get a valuable report.

Features
======

1. Running the multi-level Bayesian theorem which needs to find the joint probabilties with different variable number = 2, 3, 4, ... and up to 10 constraint by the computer capacity.
2. Defining by your questions to sort the variables and then run the decisions by the critirion of the max probaibility, median (50%), the min probability, the average.
3. Follwoing the quesitons that you set to arrange the outcomes and find the paths of decision rules for your questions.
