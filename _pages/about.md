# Introduction

At the beginning of my teaching and research stage, I began to apply economic theories to the phenomena of financial market and industrial structure. Until 2012, I met the research bottleneck and returned to basic research. The first difficulty in the research is the test method of the Durbin-Watson statistic, which I have always doubted is different from other test statistics. This is also a problem that has always existed in financial data.

Through the simulation of the probability distribution simulator and the deconstruction of Durbin-Watson statistic, I found that this method can make the economic models as a "real" random and dynamic result, and then I published several papers on the random and dynamic game theory. Of course, this is not enough to solve the economic and financial phenomena that I want to know. I need precise modeling techniques, because economic models need to find mathematical models. After 2016, the whole research method would be completed step by step. This research method includes knowledge and technology of data simulation, probability model, statistical model, estimation model and variable transformation. This convinced me that the data-driven models can be found by the accurately estimation, and can also be generated the simulated data to verify the exaction of the theoritical or data model.

I have the copyright of all the above knowledge and technology.

You can learn relevant knowledge and technology from the works by my co-authors and me. 

- There are five books published. Three books are in English, and two book is in traditional Chinese. 
- The research method used in the journal papers are also derived from the above-mentioned knowledge and techniques.

## Central limit theorem of 28 probability distributions using the probability distribution simulator

> Some cases has been published on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tbThx6Lo5s&list=PLGIquq4uoXLW1n8dU9P_NhmXrVvlU5iE2). Video is better to show the results because there are too many results for each case and this needs to exhibit the Central Limit Theorem property.
