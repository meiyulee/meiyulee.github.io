## Abstract
 This paper examines that the strategic payoffs with U-quadratic distribution, which represents the extreme values with high probability, affect the distribution of the equilibrium. In fact, the range parameters play the most important role in the game model with the extreme values of strategic payoffs. The authors discover that the intersection between the ranges of strategic payoffs and the decision rule decide the distributed shape of the equilibrium payoffs. The intersection between the ranges of strategic payoffs leads to three results as follows: (1) The equilibrium payoffs at the range between the low bound of strategic payoff and the high bound of dominantly strategic payoff; (2) The risk premium exists and is higher in the small mean case; (3) The mean effect of strategic payoffs decreases the risk premium.
